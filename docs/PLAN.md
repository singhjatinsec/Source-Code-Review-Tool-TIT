# CodeKavach Project Plan

| | |
|---|---|
| Project | CodeKavach: privacy-preserving, LLM-assisted secure source code review |
| Institution | Thapar Institute of Engineering and Technology |
| Repository | https://github.com/singhjatinsec/Source-Code-Review-Tool-TIT |
| Licence | MIT |
| Plan version | 1.0 (2026-09-21) |
| First demo | 2026-10-05 (privacy-layer proof) |
| Final submission | 2026-12-21 (v1.0 + evaluation + paper draft) |

## 1. Vision

Give any organisation an audit-grade security review of its source code, reasoned by the best available LLM, while guaranteeing that the organisation's business logic, hardcoded secrets and personal data never reach the LLM provider.

## 2. Requirements baseline

These were elicited from the project owner on 2026-09-21 and are the primary source for every design decision.

| # | Requirement | Decision |
|---|-------------|----------|
| R1 | Primary goal | Protect business logic and hardcoded secrets, API keys and PII from every LLM provider while still delivering a real code audit |
| R2 | Default privacy level | L3: redact, then slice, then pseudonymise. L0, L1, L2 and L4 selectable by policy |
| R3 | LLM providers | Any: Anthropic, OpenAI, Google Gemini, xAI Grok, AWS Bedrock, Azure OpenAI, self-hosted open models (Qwen, DeepSeek, GLM, Kimi, Llama) via Ollama or vLLM. User supplies the key |
| R4 | Interfaces | CLI, CI, GitHub Action, GitHub App, REST API server, web dashboard, VS Code extension |
| R5 | Deployment | Self-hosted, air-gapped and hosted modes |
| R6 | Languages | Python, JavaScript, TypeScript, Java, Kotlin, C, C++, PHP, Go, C#, Ruby, with a plugin path for more |
| R7 | Methodology | Built on recognised frameworks: OWASP, MITRE, NIST, CERT, PCI DSS, ISO 27001. Catalogue in `REFERENCE.md` |
| R8 | Reports | Professional audit-firm structure. PDF, DOCX, interactive HTML, SARIF, JSON, CSV, XLSX and a compliance mapping annex |
| R9 | Evidence | Text code snippets with line numbers and highlighting. No screenshots or videos |
| R10 | Issue sync | Raise findings as GitHub issues in the client's repository and add them to the client's Kanban board each agile cycle. No automatic fixing |
| R11 | Research | Tool first, then a research paper on the privacy-utility trade-off. Sources in `RESOURCE.md` |
| R12 | Transparency | Supervisor tracks progress through the GitHub project board; team of students contributes |
| R13 | Development keys | No paid API keys at the start: develop against a mock provider, a replay provider and local models; real providers verified when keys arrive |

## 3. Scope

In scope: static review of source code, configuration, dependencies and infrastructure-as-code; LLM reasoning over privacy-processed evidence; risk rating; reporting; issue tracking integration; evaluation harnesses.

Out of scope for v1.0: dynamic testing (DAST), automatic code fixing or pull requests, binary analysis, mobile app packages, runtime agents.

## 4. Guiding principles

1. **Local first.** Everything that can be done without an LLM is done locally and deterministically. The LLM is a reasoning aid for candidates the local engines produce, not a scanner that reads the repository.
2. **One way out.** Exactly one component, the egress guard, may send data to an LLM. Every payload passes leak checks and is recorded in a tamper-evident ledger the client can inspect.
3. **Reversible only at home.** Pseudonym mappings live in an encrypted vault that never leaves the client's environment.
4. **Measured, not claimed.** Privacy is quantified by attacking our own output with adversary models; detection quality is quantified on public benchmarks.
5. **Standards, not opinions.** Each finding carries CWE, OWASP, CVSS v4.0 and compliance identifiers.
6. **Provider-neutral.** No feature may depend on a single vendor's API.
7. **Fail closed.** If a privacy check cannot run, nothing is sent.

## 5. Milestones

| M2 Detection engine | 2026-10-26 | Engine adapters, native rules, taint analysis, secrets, SCA, IaC, aggregation |
| M3 LLM reasoning | 2026-11-02 | Provider matrix, review tasks, consensus, context-request loop, prompt-injection defences |
| M4 Privacy hardening | 2026-11-09 | Policy engine, L0 to L4, advanced pseudonymisation, abstract-IR mode, leakage gates |
| M5 Audit reporting | 2026-11-23 | Risk rating, compliance mapping, all report renderers |
| M6 Platforms | 2026-12-07 | API server, dashboard, GitHub Action and App, issue and board sync, VS Code extension |
| M7 Evaluation and paper | 2026-12-14 | Detection and leakage experiments, paper draft, project report |
| M8 Hardening and release | 2026-12-21 | Packaging, air-gapped bundle, security review of the tool, documentation, v1.0 |

Milestones M2 to M7 overlap in practice; the due date is when the milestone's exit criteria must hold.

### Demo 1 exit criteria (2026-10-05)

1. `codekavach scan fixtures/kavachbank` completes on a laptop with no paid API key.
2. The sample application contains planted vulnerabilities, planted secrets and recognisable business logic (an interest and fee engine).
3. `codekavach privacy inspect` shows, side by side, the original code and the exact payload prepared for the LLM: secrets replaced by typed placeholders, identifiers, strings and comments pseudonymised, only slices present.
4. An automated check proves that no planted secret and no business-domain identifier occurs anywhere in the egress ledger.
5. Findings come back mapped to the real files, lines and names.
6. An HTML and a PDF report are produced with executive summary, risk matrix, findings with snippet evidence, impact and remediation.

## 7. Way of working

- **Board.** The GitHub project board is the single source of truth. Columns: Backlog, Ready, In progress, In review, Done. Fields: Priority, Size, Epic, Milestone, Sprint.
- **Sprints.** One week, Monday to Sunday. A short sprint note is added to `docs/status/` at the end of each sprint for the supervisor.
- **Issues.** Every issue is self-contained: context, goal, tasks, technical notes, acceptance criteria, tests, dependencies, privacy considerations. Issues labelled `agent-ready` can be completed by an AI coding agent without further clarification; `needs-human` issues need a person (keys, accounts, decisions).
- **Order of work.** Within a milestone, take the lowest-numbered open issue whose blockers are all closed.
- **Commits.** Small, focused commits to `main`, each referencing its issue (`Refs #n` or `Closes #n`). CI must stay green.
- **Definition of done.** Acceptance criteria met, tests written and passing, types and lint clean, documentation updated, no privacy invariant weakened, issue closed with a short note on what was done.

## 8. Risk register

| Risk | Likelihood | Impact | Mitigation |
|------|------------|--------|------------|
| Pseudonymisation reduces LLM accuracy too far | Medium | High | Preserve public API names and security-relevant roles; measure accuracy per level from M1 onward; offer policy per path |
| Residual leakage through structure or literals | Medium | High | Egress guard leak checks; attacker-model evaluation (E37); aggregation budgets; L4 for crown-jewel paths |
| Scope is very wide for three months | High | Medium | Thin end-to-end slice first; every platform sits on the same core; depth added by priority labels |
| No paid LLM keys during development | High | Medium | Mock and replay providers; local models; provider conformance suite run when keys arrive |
| Third-party engine licences conflict with MIT or with scanning proprietary code | Medium | High | Licence verdict per engine in `docs/research/INSIGHTS.md`; engines run as external processes; optional engines clearly marked |
| Prompt injection from reviewed code | Medium | High | Comments and strings removed or neutralised at L2+; structured outputs; output validation; regression suite (E24) |
| New GitHub account rate or abuse limits | Medium | Medium | Paced issue creation and small, regular commits |
| Benchmark contamination in LLM evaluation | Medium | Medium | Use post-cutoff CVE sets and pseudonymised variants; report contamination checks |

## 9. Deliverables
